# Mastodon iOS Apps: The Complete, Ongoing List

This repository was created with the intention of providing a definitive list of all iOS apps with support for the federated social software [**Mastodon**](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon). This should include Mastodon Clients, naturally, but it should also include utilities like Linky as well as any other apps with Mastodon support (for the moment). 

Please do contribute/communicate if you see errors/missing apps in this list.
